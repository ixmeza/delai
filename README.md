# délai
## We are living through a screen
An iOS app for croissant lovers like me that need to gain its time back.
Starting this pandemic I started using my phone even more, to the point where the first thing I would do as soon as wake up would be to check my phone, and before going to bed I would do the same. 
My daily average on screen had increased to be 5 hours and my neck was starting to resent it. This is why I decided to create délai which is a word from french that means "delay"
