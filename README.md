# délai  

### We are living through a screen
**An iOS app for people like me that need to gain its time back.** 
<br><br> Starting this pandemic I started using my phone even more, to the point where the first thing I would do as soon as wake up would be to check my phone, and before going to bed I would do the same. My daily average on screen had increased to be **5 hours** and my neck was starting to resent it.:persevere: 
<br>This is why I decided to create délai which is a word from french that means "time limit" :alarm_clock: to take a break (and eat that pastry!)
